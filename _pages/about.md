I am a third-year Ph.D. student (enrolled in 2022) in Cyberspace Security at Southeast University, advised by [Professor Guilin Qi]([https://pages.github.com/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). My research interests broadly cover multimodal learning, knowledge editing and machine unlearning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Currently, my work focuses on machine unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Model and Diffusion Model. It aims to address safety and privacy challenges in Multimodal Foundation Models by removing unintended generated content.
